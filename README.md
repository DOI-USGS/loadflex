## `loadflex`: Models and tools for watershed flux estimates

This package implements several of the most common methods for modeling and
predicting watershed solute fluxes and concentrations, including interpolation
and regression models, period-weighted averaging, and the composite method.
loadflex integrates seamlessly with the USGS's
[rloadest](https://github.com/USGS-R/rloadest) package and with native R
regression models. It offers a uniform interface for any model type, with which
you can quickly fit models, generate predictions, and aggregate to monthly or
annual values.

The package was created by [Alison Appling](https://github.com/aappling-usgs) 
and [Miguel Leon](https://github.com/miguelcleon) with the support of [Bill 
McDowell](https://colsa.unh.edu/faculty/mcdowell) and the [McDowell 
lab](http://wrrc.unh.edu/mcdowell-lab-current) at the University of New 
Hampshire, 2013-2015. Funding for the project was provided by the National 
Science Foundation, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and the NH 
Agricultural Experiment Station. Funding for the example dataset from the 
Lamprey River was provied by the EPA, NH Water Resources Research Center, NH 
Agricultural Experiment Station, NH Sea Grant, USGS, and NSF. This work is 
described in

Additional development and maintenance in 2016-present is being done by 
[Alison Appling](https://github.com/aappling-usgs), [Lindsay
Carr](https://github.com/lindsaycarr), and [David 
Watkins](https://github.com/wdwatkins) of the [USGS Office of Water 
Information](http://cida.usgs.gov/datascience.html).

### Package Support

The Water Mission Area of the USGS supports maintenance of `loadflex` through September 2018, and likely further into the future. Resources are available primarily for maintenance and responding to user questions. Some new features may be added as prioritized by the `loadflex` development team.

## Installation of R and RStudio

This section should only need to be done once per computer.

The following link walks you through an installation of R and RStudio:

[Installation Instructions](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/intro-curriculum/Before/)

If you follow those instructions exactly, you should have the USGS R repository (GRAN) added to your R profile. If that step doesn't ring a bell, paste the following into your R console:

```r
rprofile_path = file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".Rprofile")
write('\noptions(repos=c(getOption(\'repos\'),
    CRAN=\'https://cloud.r-project.org\',
    USGS=\'https://owi.usgs.gov/R\'))\n',
      rprofile_path, 
      append =  TRUE)

cat('Your Rprofile has been updated to include GRAN.
    Please restart R for changes to take effect.')
```

*RESTART RSTUDIO!*

* [Download R Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


## Installation of loadflex

This section should also only have to be done once. It assumes the USGS R repository (GRAN) was added to your R profile as described above.

```r
install.packages("loadflex")
```

Regularly, it is a good idea to update *ALL* your packages in R. If using RStudio, this is quite easy, there's an Update button in the "Packages" tab. This checks CRAN and GRAN for updates. It is a good idea to click this update regularly.

### Install Development Version:

To install the current development version of the package*:
```r
devtools::install_github("USGS-R/loadflex")
```
*You will want to initially install `loadflex` via the `install.packages` steps described above to get the non-CRAN package dependencies properly installed.


Also please see the installation FAQ on the wiki
(https://github.com/USGS-R/loadflex/wiki/Installation-FAQ) if you run into trouble.
