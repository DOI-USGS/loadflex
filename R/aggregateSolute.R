#' Aggregate loads by the time periods specified by the user
#' 
#' This will aggregate the total loads or mean concentrations per aggregation 
#' interval, specified by \code{agg.by}. The time frame specified by 
#' \code{agg.by} can be "unit," "day," "month," "water year," "calendar year," 
#' "total," or the name of a column in newdata that can be used to group the 
#' data.
#' 
#' This also calculates the uncertainty in the sum over a regular time series 
#' (loads) with known standard errors (loadsSEs) for each short-term load 
#' estimate.
#' 
#' The general equation for propagation of error in a sum of potentially 
#' autocorrelated values is:
#' 
#' sum_t(var(x[t])) + 2*sum_a,b(cov(x_a,a_t+l))
#' 
#' where we will assume something about the covariance matrix.
#' 
#' However, we will deviate from the above equation to accommodate the lognormal
#' distribution of each flux prediction.

#' @param preds Either a vector of predicted instantaneous fluxes or 
#'   concentrations or a data.frame containing the columns "fit", "se.pred", and
#'   "date"
#' @param metadata A metadata object describing the model
#' @param format character. The desired format of the aggregated values. If 
#'   "conc", preds is assumed to already be formatted as "conc". If "flux" or 
#'   "flux rate", preds is assumed to already be formatted as "flux rate". If 
#'   preds has a "units" attribute, that attribute is checked for consistency 
#'   with \code{format} and \code{metadata}, but if preds has no "units" 
#'   attribute then no such checks can be made.
#' @param agg.by character. The date interval or grouping column by which to 
#'   aggregate. If agg.by="unit", values will be returned unaggregated but in 
#'   the standard post-aggregation format. If agg.by is one of "day", "month", 
#'   "water year", or "calendar year", the dates vector will be split into 
#'   periods corresponding to those intervals, and the flux or concentration 
#'   will be computed for each period. If agg.by="total", \code{dates} will be 
#'   ignored and the entire vector \code{preds} will be aggregated. If 
#'   agg.by="[custom]", aggregation will occur for each unique value in 
#'   \code{dates}.
#' @param se.preds A vector of standard errors of prediction for instantaneous 
#'   flux or concentration predictions. This data may also be given as a column 
#'   named "se.pred" in preds when preds is a data.frame.
#' @param dates A vector, of the same length as preds, containing the dates to 
#'   aggregate over. This data may also be given as a column named "date" in 
#'   preds when preds is a data.frame.
#' @param custom An optional data.frame of one or more columns each containing 
#'   factors or other labels on which to aggregate. The columns to be used are 
#'   set by \code{agg.by}.
#' @param cormat.function A function that takes a vector of datetimes (Date, 
#'   POSIXct, chron, etc.) and returns a Matrix indicating the assumed/estimated
#'   correlation between prediction errors on each pair of datetimes. See 
#'   \link{correlations-2D} for predefined options.
#' @param ci.agg logical. Should confidence intervals for the aggregate 
#'   predictions be returned?
#' @param level numeric. The interval to span with the confidence intervals.
#' @param deg.free numeric. The degrees of freedom to use in calculating 
#'   confidence intervals from SEPs. If NA, a normal distribution is used rather
#'   than the more standard t distribution.
#' @param ci.distrib character. The distribution to assume for uncertainty in 
#'   the aggregate flux or concentration distribution. The default is 
#'   "lognormal".
#' @param se.agg logical. Should standard errors of the aggregate predictions be
#'   returned?
#' @param na.rm logical. Should NA values be ignored during aggregation (TRUE), 
#'   or should NA be returned for intervals that contain one or more NA 
#'   predictions (FALSE)?
#' @param attach.units logical. If true, units will be attached as an attribute 
#'   of the second column of the returned data.frame.
#'   
#' @return A data.frame with two columns. The first contains the aggregation 
#'   period or custom aggregation unit and is named after the value of 
#'   \code{agg.by}. The second contains the aggregate flux or concentration 
#'   estimates and is named after the value of \code{format}. The values in the 
#'   second column will be in the units specified by \code{metadata}.

    # + 0.5*sigma^2)). In other words, this is the standard equation relating

    # calculated for us as the values returned when you call predictSolute with

    # really hard to calculate the variance at a lag close to the length of the

    # distance); this is therefore a small sample problem. So if you choose, you

    # for any value of lag.num, but another good choice is 1-(l/(L+1)) as 
    # suggested by Newey and West (1987); other weights were suggested in papers 
    # subsequent to that one. If you do use such a weighting function, you should
    # choose L wisely; it should probably be constant across all aggregation

  ### Notes on Uncertainty ### 
  
  # We may find that a faster way to estimate the uncertainty in this sum 
  # is by Monte Carlo simulation, using the means and variances (or se.preds) of 
  # instantaneous fluxes to parametrically resample from those distributions, 
  # find the sum, and repeat until we have a population of sums from which we 
  # can estimate a distribution. See, for example, 
  # http://eprints.sics.se/2253/1/SICS-T--2002-01--SE.pdf ("Evaluating the CDF 
  # for m weighted sums of n correlated lognormal random variables", Lars
