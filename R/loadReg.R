  # n - k is supposed to be degrees of freedom. eq. 36 has df = v = 
  # 2N*((1+Bs2/N)^2/Vs2s2). If I understand right that the calculation of S2_U 
  # (S2_U <- S2/(1+BIAS[NPAR+1]), above) is the same equation as in paragraph 
  # 29, then Bs2/N is stored in BIAS[NPAR+1]. Vs2s2 is probably 
  # CV[NPAR+1,NPAR+1], though I'd like more evidence to be sure. To be like an 
  # lm, n.minus.k should be close to 23 for the app2 data (less if there were 
  # censored data). What I get with 2*NOBSC*((1+BIAS[NPAR+1])^2 / 
  # CV[NPAR+1,NPAR+1]) happens to be exactly the square of 23...so...take the 
  # sqrt? I guess I will...Ultimately, though, we could head for sigma^2=v*sA^2 
  # / chi_v^2 which chi_v^2 is a random variable with the given chi-square 
  # distribution, v degrees of freedom. Alternatively, Eqn. 41 gives a second relation

  # square with df=n.minus.k? Could be close but not perfect. rloadest::EXPON.f

  # To adjust the model enough that new predictions reflect the resampled

  # up to date (because these are the variables used by 
  # predLoad/estlday/TAC_LOAD to calculate MVUE, which are the point load 
  # estimates). The other arguments to TAC_LOAD are NPAR and XLPRED; of those,
  # NPAR should stay the same, and XLPRED will be computed by the predLoad or
  # predConc call from the new predictor data, so we don't need to worry about
  # them.

  # print.loadReg. It's quick enough, I guess...let's replace it here.

  # Leave BIAS, CV, SBIAS, and SCV untouched for prediction of new points. 
  # Prediction of intervals doesn't matter; simulateSolute offers no uncertainty

  # for the g_v(...) term in eq. 42) - BIAS and CV go into the calculation of 
  # ALPHA and KAPPA, and SBIAS and SCV go into the calculation of GAMMA, A1, and
  # B1. All that said, I think their original values are the ones we want: bias 
  # and the covariance structure of the coefficients shouldn't change just
  # because we resample the coefficients.
