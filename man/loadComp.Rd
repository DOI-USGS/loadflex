\title{Create a fitted loadComp object.}
\usage{
loadComp(reg.model, interp.format = c("flux", "conc"),
  abs.or.rel.resids = c("absolute", "relative"), use.log = TRUE,
  interp.data, interp.function = linearInterpolation, store = c("data",
  "fitting.function"), n.iter = 100, MSE.method = "parametric")
}
\arguments{
\item{reg.model}{The model, usually a regression model, to whose predictions
the residuals corrections should be added.}

\item{interp.format}{character specifying the load format in which residuals
should be interpolated}

\item{abs.or.rel.resids}{Should residuals be computed as the difference
("absolute") or the ratio ("relative") of the observed and predicted
values?}

\item{use.log}{logical. Should residuals be computed in log space (TRUE) or
linear space (FALSE)?}

\item{interp.data}{the dataset, possibly differing from
getFittingData(reg.model), from which regression residuals will be
calculated and interpolated.}

\item{interp.function}{a function accepting args dates.in, y.in, and
dates.out and returning y.out. See \link{interpolations} for pre-defined
options, or write your own having the same form.}

\item{store}{One or more character strings specifying which information to
write within the model. Options are 'data': the original fitting data;
'fitting.function': a fitting function that can produce a new loadComp
object from new data (this currently uses the same new data for both
regression calibration and interpolation); 'uncertainty': an estimate of
uncertainty, which can take some time to compute but will permit creation
of uncertainty intervals, etc. in the prediction and aggregation phases.}

\item{n.iter}{The number of times to repeat the COMPLETE process of [simulate
predictions from the regression model and do leave-one-out cross validation
(for all interpolation data points)]. Each run through the process
generates one estimate of the MSE, from which a mean and SD of the MSE
estimates will be returned.}

\item{MSE.method}{character. The method by which the model should be
bootstrapped. "non-parametric": resample with replacement from the original
fitting data, refit the model, and make new predictions. "parametric":
resample the model coefficients based on the covariance matrix originally
estimated for those coefficients, then make new predictions.}
}
\value{
A fitted loadComp model.
}
\description{
Generates a new model of class loadComp (\code{\link{loadComp-class}}).
loadComps themselves contain two inner load models, one for regression and
one for interpolation of the residuals of the regression predictions.
