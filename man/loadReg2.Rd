\usage{
loadReg2(load.reg, pred.format = c("flux", "conc"), store = c("data",
  "fitting.function"), consti.name = "", load.rate = "",
  site.id = "", lat = as.numeric(NA), lon = as.numeric(NA),

}
\arguments{
\item{load.reg}{An unevaluated call to \code{\link[rloadest]{loadReg}}. This
call will be parsed and evaluated within \code{loadReg2} to create a fully
functional load model for use within \pkg{loadflex}.}

\item{pred.format}{character. Should predictions be made for 'flux' (load
rate) or 'conc' (concentration)? \pkg{rloadest}, and therefore loadReg2,
uses different models for flux and concentration, though fitted to the same
data and with the same model structure except for whether the left-hand
side of the model formula is load rate or concentration. The model specific
to \code{pred.format} will be used to generate predictions.}

\item{store}{One or more character strings specifying which information to
write within the model. Options are 'data': the original fitting data;
'fitting.function': a fitting function that can produce a new loadComp
object from new data}

\item{consti.name}{character. Consituent long name, for use in plots and 
reports}

\item{load.rate}{character. The name of the data.frame column, if it exists, 
describing instantaneous load}

\item{site.id}{character Station ID for the site where the concentration of 
the constituent was measured.}

\item{lat}{numeric Station latitude where concentration (and possibly also 
discharge) was measured.}

\item{lon}{numeric Station longitude where concentration (and possibly also 
discharge) was measured.}

\item{basin.area}{numeric Area of the drainage basin contributing water to 
the site where concentrations were measured.}

\item{flow.site.name}{character Long name of the station where flow was 
monitored, if different from where concentration was monitored (as in 
\code{site.name}).}

\item{flow.site.id}{character Station ID of the station where flow was 
monitored, if different from where concentration was monitored (as in 
\code{site.id}).}

\item{flow.lat}{numeric Latitude of the station where flow was monitored, if 
different from where concentration was monitored (as in \code{site.lat}).}

\item{flow.lon}{numeric Longitude of the station where flow was monitored, if
different from where concentration was monitored (as in \code{site.lon}).}

\item{flow.basin.area}{numeric Area of the drainage basin contributing water 
to the site where flow was monitored, if different from where concentration
was monitored (as in \code{basin.area}).}

\item{basin.area.units}{character Units of the values in \code{basin.area} 
and \code{flow.basin.area} (must be the same for both). Basin areas are 
used to compute yields as loads per contributing (basin) area.}

\item{custom}{ANY. Empty by default, but may be modified to store any 
additional data the user wants to track.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to this model.}
}
\value{
A fitted loadReg2 model.

\description{
Generates a new model of class loadReg2 (\code{\link{loadReg2-class}}).
loadReg2s are wrappers for loadReg objects produced by the USGS
\pkg{rloadest} package. \code{loadReg2}s can implement the
\code{\link{loadModelInterface}} more reliably than is possible for a
\code{loadReg} object. Some metadata information is set within the loadReg()
call; entries that can be edited may be given as arguments to the loadReg2()
call (e.g., site.id, lat, lon, basin.area).
