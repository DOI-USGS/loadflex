\title{Estimate the autocorrelation of a mid- to high-resolution time series}
\usage{
estimateRho(load.model, flux.or.conc = c("flux", "conc"),
  abs.or.rel.resids = c("absolute", "relative"), use.log = FALSE,
  newdata = NULL, plot.acf = TRUE,
  timestep.tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5, irregular.timesteps.ok = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{load.model}{a loadModel descendant}

\item{flux.or.conc}{The format in which residuals should be calculated}

\item{abs.or.rel.resids}{Should residuals be computed as the difference or 
the ratio of the observed and predicted values?}

\item{use.log}{logical. use log residuals?}

\item{newdata}{prediction values. If this is set to NULL, 
\code{getFittingData(load.model)} will be used.}

\item{plot.acf}{logical. Should the autocorrelation function be plotted?}

\item{timestep.tol}{the acceptable tolerance for considering timesteps 
regular.}

\item{irregular.timesteps.ok}{logical. If FALSE, this function requires that 
the timesteps between observations are identical to one another, and a plot
is generated and an error is thrown if this requirement is not met. If 
TRUE, the check is not performed. If NA (the default), the check is 
performed but the function proceeds with a warning and no plot if the 
timesteps are found to be irregular. Estimates of autocorrelation are weak
to wrong when timesteps are irregular, but timesteps are often at least a
bit irregular in the real world.}
}
\value{
Return the rho function and the fitted model.
}
\description{
Uses arima() to estimate the first-order autocorrelation constant, rho, for 
the residuals calculated from a load model and new data.
}
\details{
For the purpose of estimating prediction error for a composite method 
application, this function should be called with a dataset of comparable (or 
identical) resolution to that of the interpolation data.

For the purpose of estimating the covariance of prediction errors for 
aggregation, this function should not be called unless newdata are at 
approximately the same (or higher) temporal resolution as that of the data to
be used for load estimation. This will almost always involve sensor data.

If you have no data with sufficient resolution to reasonably call this 
function, take your pick from the established assumptions implemented in 
functions such as \code{\link{rhoEqualDates}} or \code{\link{rho1DayBand}}, 
or write your own assumptions.
