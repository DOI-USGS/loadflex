\title{Make flux or concentration predictions from a loadInterp model.}
\usage{
\method{predictSolute}{loadInterp}(load.model, flux.or.conc = c("flux",
  "conc"), newdata, date = TRUE, count = TRUE, se.fit = FALSE,
  se.pred = FALSE, interval = c("none", "prediction"), level = 0.95,
  lin.or.log = c("linear", "log"), agg.by = c("unit", "day", "month",
  "water year", "calendar year", "total", "[custom]"), na.rm = FALSE,
  attach.units = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{load.model}{A loadInterp object.}

\item{flux.or.conc}{character. Should the predictions be reported as flux
rates or concentrations? If the output is a data.frame, the column name for
flux predictions will be "fit" when `agg.by='unit'` and "Flux_Rate"
otherwise; the column name for concentration predictions will be "fit" when
`agg.by='unit'` and "Conc" otherwise.}

\item{newdata}{\code{data.frame}, optional. Predictor data. Because
loadInterp models interpolate in time among the observations to which they
have been "fitted", \code{newdata} is usually simply a one-column
data.frame of dates or date-times. Column names should match those given in
the \code{loadInterp} metadata. If \code{newdata} is not supplied, the
original fitting data will be used.}

\item{date}{logical. If TRUE, the output data.frame will include a column
containing the dates or grouping variables of the predictions. For
agg.by=="unit", the resulting column will be "date"; for agg.by=="water
year", the column will be "water.year", and so on.}

\item{count}{logical. If TRUE, and if agg.by!='unit', the output data.frame
will include a column named 'count' containing the number of unit
predictions going into each aggregated prediction (row).}

\item{se.fit}{logical. Must be FALSE because se.fit is unavailable for
loadInterp models.}

\item{se.pred}{logical. If TRUE, the output data.frame will include a column
named "se.pred" describing the standard error of the prediction for each
row of predictors. The se.pred values are standard errors of prediction
(SEPs) and take into account not only the parameter uncertainty associated
with the model coefficients (also covered by se.fit), but also the random
error associated with any given observation (the epsilon term in a typical
regression model).}

\item{interval}{character specifying the type of interval to include, if any. Prediction intervals
are only available when `agg.by=="unit"`, and confidence intervals are not
available for any loadInterp predictions. If "prediction", the interval
bounds will be returned in columns named "lwr.pred" and "upr.pred". Prediction bounds
describe the expected distribution of observations at each prediction
point. The extent of the}

\item{level}{numeric. Fraction of density distribution to include within the
confidence or prediction interval}

\item{lin.or.log}{character. Either "linear" or "log" to say whether the
predictions should be converted to log space or not. If converted to log
space, a bias correction will be applied to regression model predictions;
see \code{\link{linToLog}}.}

\item{agg.by}{character. The date interval or other grouping variable to
aggregate results by. To do no aggregation, use the default of
`agg.by='unit'`. If agg.by is one of "day", "month", "water year", or
"calendar year", the dates vector will be split into periods corresponding
to those intervals, and the flux or concentration will be computed for each
period. If agg.by="total", \code{dates} will be ignored and the entire
vector \code{preds} will be aggregated, weighting each point prediction
equally. If agg.by is set to one or most custom values not in the list of
default values, the values should be names of columns in `newdata`, and
predictions will be grouped according to the values in those columns.}

\item{na.rm}{logical. Should NA values be removed before aggregation (TRUE),
or should NA be returned for intervals that contain one or more NA
predictions (FALSE)?}

\item{attach.units}{logical. Should the units be attached to columns in the
resulting data.frame?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to class-specific implementations of
the \code{predictSolute} generic function.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector or data.frame of predictions preditions. The result
  is a vector if interval is "none" and all of se.fit, se.pred, date, and
  count are FALSE; otherwise, the result is a data.frame.

Makes instantaneous predictions (at the temporal resolution of

\details{
loadInterps are currently assumed to have normally distributed residuals. An
unwitting user might violate this assumption without being notified by the
code, so be careful! This assumption is mainly relevant to the calculation of
prediction intervals. Also, where other models such as loadReg and loadLm
will retransform predictions back into linear space, loadInterps will not.
