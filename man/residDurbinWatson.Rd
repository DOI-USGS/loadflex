\title{Test for autocorrelation of residuals}
\usage{
residDurbinWatson(load.model, flux.or.conc = c("flux", "conc"),
  abs.or.rel.resids = c("absolute", "relative"), use.log = FALSE,
  newdata = NULL, plot.acf = TRUE,
  timestep.tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5, irregular.timesteps.ok = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{load.model}{a loadModel descendant}

\item{flux.or.conc}{character. The format in which residuals should be 
calculated}

\item{abs.or.rel.resids}{character. Should residuals be computed as the 
difference or the ratio of the observed and predicted values?}

\item{use.log}{logical. use log residuals?}

\item{newdata}{The data from which to compute residuals; if NULL, the 
original fitting data for load.model will be used.}

\item{plot.acf}{logical. Should the autocorrelation function be plotted?}

\item{timestep.tol}{the acceptable tolerance for considering timesteps 
regular.}

\item{irregular.timesteps.ok}{logical. If FALSE, this function requires that 
the timesteps between observations are identical to one another, and a plot
is generated and an error is thrown if this requirement is not met. If 
TRUE, the check is not performed. If NA (the default), the check is 
performed but the function proceeds with a warning and no plot if the 
timesteps are found to be irregular. Tests of autocorrelation are weak to
wrong when timesteps are irregular, but timesteps are often at least a bit
irregular in the real world.}
}
\value{
A Durbin-Watson test statistic applied to residuals.
}
\description{
Extracts residuals from a load.model (where residuals may be for the 
calibration data or for a new set of observations). Applies 
car::durbinWatsonTest to test for autocorrelation of those residuals.
