\title{Estimate uncertainty in a composite model.}
\usage{
\method{estimateMSE}{loadComp}(load.model, n.iter = 100,
  method = "parametric", rho, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{load.model}{A load model object, typically inheriting from loadModel
and always implementing the loadModelInterface.}

\item{n.iter}{The number of times to repeat the COMPLETE process of [simulate
predictions from the regression model and do leave-one-out cross validation
(for all interpolation data points)]. Each run through the process
generates one estimate of the MSE, from which a mean and SD of the MSE
estimates will be returned.}

\item{method}{character. The method by which the model should be
bootstrapped. "non-parametric": resample with replacement from the original
fitting data, refit the model, and make new predictions. "parametric":
resample the model coefficients based on the covariance matrix originally
estimated for those coefficients, then make new predictions.}

\item{rho}{The first-order autocorrelation coefficient to assume in
simulateSolute(regression.model, interpolation.data). If missing, rho will
be estimated from the interpolation data, but be warned that many data
points are needed to make this estimation with precision.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to inheriting methods for estimateMSE}
}
\description{
Calculates and returns the mean squared errors (MSEs) in the units and
transformation space (e.g., log space) of the left-hand side of the model fit
equation.
}
\details{
This method is leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) for the interpolation
and involves repeated resampling of the coefficients from which the
regression predictions and residuals are calculated.
