\title{Extract model summary statistics from a loadComp model}
\usage{
\method{summarizeModel}{loadComp}(load.model, newdata,
  irregular.timesteps.ok = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{load.model}{A load model object, typically inheriting from loadModel
and always implementing the loadModelInterface.}

\item{newdata}{data.frame of data that was/will be used to predict
concentration or load; should be the same as the \code{newdata} argument to
\code{predictSolute}, e.g. a data.frame of daily or instantaneous dates and
discharges.}

\item{irregular.timesteps.ok}{logical. If FALSE, this function requires that
the timesteps between observations are identical to one another, and a plot
is generated and an error is thrown if this requirement is not met. If
TRUE, the check is not performed. If NA (the default), the check is
performed but the function proceeds with a warning and no plot if the
timesteps are found to be irregular. Tests and estimates of autocorrelation
are weak to wrong when timesteps are irregular, but timesteps are often at
least a bit irregular in the real world.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to model-specific methods}
}
\value{
Returns a 1-row data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{site.id} - the unique identifier of the site, as in \code{\link[=metadata]{metadata()}}
\item \code{constituent} - the unique identifier of the constituent, as in
\code{\link[=metadata]{metadata()}}
\item \code{RMSE.lin} or \code{RMSE.log} - the square root of the mean squared error, in
log space (\code{RMSE.log}) if the \code{use.log} equalled \code{TRUE} in the call to
\code{\link[=loadComp]{loadComp()}} that created this model.
\item \code{reg.durbin.watson} - the Durbin Watson test statistic as applied to the
residuals from the regression model fitting process
\item \code{reg.rho} - the autocorrelation coefficient of the residuals from the
regression model fitting process
\item \code{int.durbin.watson} - the Durbin Watson test statistic as applied to the
residuals from the interpolation model fitting process. See
\code{\link[=residDurbinWatson]{residDurbinWatson()}}
\item \code{int.rho} - the autocorrelation coefficient of the residuals from the
interpolation model fitting process. See \code{\link[=estimateRho]{estimateRho()}}
\item \code{correction.frac} - the correction fraction, i.e., the fraction of total
concentration or flux prediction that is attributable to a correction such
as the residuals correction of composite method models. See
\code{\link[=getCorrectionFraction]{getCorrectionFraction()}}
}
}
\description{
Produce a 1-row data.frame of model metrics. The relevant metrics for
loadComp models include two sets of statistics about autocorrelation (one for
the regression residuals, one for the 'residuals' used to do the composite
correction).
