\title{Simulate solute concentrations based on the model and model uncertainty.}
\usage{
simulateSolute(load.model, flux.or.conc = c("flux", "conc"), newdata,
  method = c("non-parametric", "parametric"),
  from.interval = c("confidence", "prediction"), rho, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{load.model}{A load model object, typically inheriting from loadModel 
and always implementing the loadModelInterface.}

\item{flux.or.conc}{character. Should the simulations be reported as flux
rates or concentrations?}

\item{newdata}{An optional data.frame of predictor observations. The column 
names in this data.frame must match those specified in the load model's 
metadata.}

\item{method}{character. The method by which the model should be 
bootstrapped. "non-parametric": resample with replacement from the original
fitting data, refit the model, and make new predictions. "parametric":
resample the model coefficients based on the covariance matrix originally
estimated for those coefficients, then make new predictions.}

\item{from.interval}{character. The interval type from which to resample 
(simulate) the solute. If "confidence", the regression model coefficients 
are resampled from their multivariate normal distribution and predictions 
are made from the new coefficients. If "prediction", an additional vector 
of noise is added to those "confidence"-based predictions.}

\item{rho}{An autocorrelation coefficient to assume for the residuals, 
applicable when from.interval=="prediction". If rho is missing and 
interval=="prediction", rho will be estimated from the residuals calculated
from newdata with the fitted (not yet resampled) load.model.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to inheriting methods}
}
\value{
A vector or data.frame of predictions, as for the generic 
  \code{\link{predictSolute}}. The simulated predictions are distributed 
  according to the uncertainty of the coefficients (if 
  from.interval=="confidence") and also the estimated natural variability + 
  measurement error (if from.interval=="prediction").
}
\description{
This function is an optional component of the \link{loadModelInterface}. It 
is unnecessary for model fitting, assessment, and prediction except when used
in conjunction with the composite method (i.e., within a 
\code{\link{loadComp}} model).
