\title{loadInterp is a class of load models that hold interpolation functions.
The engine of a loadInterp model.}
\description{
This is a model class to nest within loadInterp. This class, interpModel, is
lightweight relative to loadInterp: its focus is on the interpolation rather
than on units conversions, fitting, or other things that loadInterp does
better. This is also the class that is produced by a call to the fitting
function stored in loadInterp.
